# Backup and Disaster Recovery for Amazon EKS resources using NetApp Trident Protect

For customers running applications and workloads on Kubernetes, protecting resources and data from accidental deletion or hardware failures is crucial for maintaining business continuity and meeting compliance requirements. While Kubernetes provides high availability through its control plane and worker node redundancy, it does not inherently protect against human errors, such as accidental deletion of namespaces, deployments, or persistent volumes, nor does it safeguard against regional failures or data corruption. Implementing a comprehensive backup strategy for Amazon EKS clusters is essential to ensure that application data can be recovered quickly and reliably. This includes backing up essential components such as entire namespaces, persistent volumes containing application data, custom resources, and configuration objects. Without proper backup mechanisms, organizations risk extended outages, data loss, and potential breach of service level agreements (SLAs), which can result in significant financial impact and damage to customer trust. The complexity of modern microservices architectures and the increasing scale of Kubernetes deployments make it even more critical to maintain regular, tested backups that can be restored consistently across different environments and regions.

### Trident Protect
[Trident Protect](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-protect/learn-about-trident-protect.html) is a new free-to-use tool that can provide Kubernetes cluster data protection, data migration, and disaster recovery. Trident Protect simplifies the management, protection, and movement of containerized workloads across public clouds (such as AWS) and on-premises environments. Trident Protect can help manage different on-demand or on-schedule data protection tasks for Kubernetes cluster resources and persistent volumes to externally supported storage backends like Amazon S3. It offers automation capabilities through its Kubernetes-native API and powerful `tridentctl-protect` CLI, enabling programmatic access for seamless integration with existing workflows. 

AWS users can leverge Trident Protect to handle different data protection and migration tasks for thier [Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/eks/?trk=95db30c5-8506-4271-948a-5fa4694b61c9&sc_channel=ps&ef_id=Cj0KCQjwqIm_BhDnARIsAKBYcmvY361xnMLrfWn5-v27q3gaRsX8qLYTAOE5ZwvolTuEQg4lFqvgAYgaArTJEALw_wcB:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!717563061585!e!!g!!amazon%20eks!21818515084!169838282878&gbraid=0AAAAADjHtp8UJy7pj6FXbvPrOCQO-e99E&gclid=Cj0KCQjwqIm_BhDnARIsAKBYcmvY361xnMLrfWn5-v27q3gaRsX8qLYTAOE5ZwvolTuEQg4lFqvgAYgaArTJEALw_wcB) clusters. Operations like cross-cluster disaster recovery (between regions or within a region), migration of stateful services between storage services, or moving resources running on a self-managed cluster into EKS can be simplified and easily automated.

### General Archtecture
In this blog post, we will focus on using Trident Protect to handle data protection and migration tasks for a sample application running on an Amazon EKS cluster. We'll also deep-dive into some backup, recovery, and storage migration options that will help you decide what is best to implement in your organization's environment.  

The architecture below creates local backup copies in our local region, which can be used to restore other namespaces within the same cluster and migrate from different AWS storage services. 

### Software Architecture
Throughout the workflow of this blog, we will use the AWS [retail store sample application](https://github.com/aws-containers/retail-store-sample-app) as our basic software stack.
This application is built from microservices and backed by several stateful services. In total they consume 4 [Persistent Volume Claims](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/) (PVC) for each stack:
- Assets - Serves static assets like images related to the product catalog - Requires RWX volume like NFS
- Orders - Receive and process customer orders backed by MySQL DB and RabbitMQ - Requires 2 RWO block storage volumes
- Catalog - Product listings and details backed by MySQL DB - Requires RWO block storage volume

## Walkthrough
### Prerequisites 
- EKS cluster deployed version 1.32
    - Pod Identity (eks-pod-identity-agent) add-on version v1.3.4
    - NetApp Trident CSI add-on version 25.02
    - AWS EBS CSI add-on version v1.40.0-eksbuild.1
    - Snapshot controller (snapshot-controller) add-on version v8.0.0
        - Create `VolumeSnapshotClass` for EBS and FSxN (sample manifests are provisioned as part of the terraform: [EBS](./manifests/ebs-volume-snapshot-class) and [FSxN](./manifests/fsxn-volume-snapshot-class)) 
    - Load balancer controller (aws-load-balancer-controller) version 2.11.0
- Deployed FSxN file system 

### 1. Create required infrastructure
Clone the sample repository from GitHub and create all relevant resources using the Terraform code in that repository:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-eks-backup-with-trident-protect
$ cd sample-eks-backup-with-trident-protect/terraform
$ terraform init
$ terraform apply -auto-approve
```
> [!NOTE]
> The terraform script will prompt you to input a public IP address. This is the host's address that will access the UI of the sample application. 
>```shell
>var.ui_service_public_ip
>  The public IP addess of the host that will access the sample application >UI from the web browser
>
>  Enter a value: 70.70.70.70/32      
>```

This process can take 20-25 minutes to complete. When finished, the output of the command should look like this:

```shell
fsx-management-ip = toset([
  "10.0.1.13",
])
fsx-ontap-id = "fs-03197c52f4cd331ff"
fsx-svm-name = "ekssvm"
region = "us-east-1"
secret_arn = "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:139763910815:secret:fsxn-password-secret-8DKLpwTi-8DLlwE"
zz_update_kubeconfig_command = "aws eks update-kubeconfig --name eks-protect-8DKLpwTi --alias eks-primary --region us-east-1"
```

Next, copy and run the AWS CLI command from the `update_kubeconfig_command` output above and check we’re able to reach the cluster by running `kubectl get nodes`:
```shell
NAME                         STATUS   ROLES    AGE     VERSION
ip-10-0-1-120.ec2.internal   Ready    <none>   2m15s   v1.32.1-eks-5d632ec
ip-10-0-1-125.ec2.internal   Ready    <none>   95m     v1.32.1-eks-5d632ec
ip-10-0-2-42.ec2.internal    Ready    <none>   95m     v1.32.1-eks-5d632ec
ip-10-0-2-95.ec2.internal    Ready    <none>   2m9s    v1.32.1-eks-5d632ec
```
### 2. Deploy Trident Protect
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure you change clusterName to the EKS cluster name in your environment
```shell
helm repo add netapp-trident-protect https://netapp.github.io/trident-protect-helm-chart
helm install trident-protect-crds netapp-trident-protect/trident-protect-crds --namespace trident-protect --create-namespace
helm install trident-protect netapp-trident-protect/trident-protect --version 100.2502.0 --set clusterName=eks-protect-8DKLpwTi --namespace trident-protect
```
Expected output:
```shell
"netapp-trident-protect" has been added to your repositories
NAME: trident-protect-crds
LAST DEPLOYED: Tue Mar 11 15:57:42 2025
NAMESPACE: trident-protect
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
NAME: trident-protect
LAST DEPLOYED: Tue Mar 11 16:01:09 2025
NAMESPACE: trident-protect
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
```
### 3. Create AWS S3 Bucket
If you have an existing S3 bucket, you can use it. If not, used the following steps to create a new S3 bucket. Replace `<bucket_name>` and `<aws_region>` with your values:
```shell
aws s3 mb s3://<bucket_name> --region <aws_region>
```

### 4. Create EKS Secret to store user credentials
Create a secret to store the trident protect user AWS accessKey and secretKey. If your account requires this, you can also use a sessionToken.
Use the following example to create the secret:
```shell
kubectl create secret generic <secret-name> \
--from-literal=accessKeyID=<accessKey> \
--from-literal=secretAccessKey=<seceretKey> \
--from-literal=sessionToken=<sessionToken> \
-n trident-protect
```

### 5. Create Trident Protect AppVault
Next, we'll create the Trident Protect `AppVault`. The `AppVault` points to the S3 bucket where we'll store our backups. 
To create the `AppVault`, use the [protect-vault.yaml](./manifests/protect-vault.yaml) sample manifest.
```yaml
---
apiVersion: protect.trident.netapp.io/v1
kind: AppVault
metadata:
  name: amazon-s3-trident-protect-src-bucket
  namespace: trident-protect
spec:
  properties:
    dataMoverPasswordSecretRef: my-optional-data-mover-secret
  providerType: AWS
  providerConfig:
    s3:
      bucketName: trident-protect-src-bucket
      endpoint: s3.example.com
  providerCredentials:
    accessKeyID:
      valueFromSecret:
        key: accessKeyID
        name: s3-secret
    secretAccessKey:
      valueFromSecret:
        key: secretAccessKey
        name: s3-secret
    sessionToken:
      valueFromSecret:
        key: sessionToken
        name: s3-secret
```
Run the following command to create the `AppVault`:
```shell
kubectl create -f ../manifests/protect-vault.yaml
```
To check if the `AppVault` was created successfully run the following command:
```shell
kubectl get appvault -n trident-protect
```
Expected output:
```shell
NAME                STATE       ERROR   MESSAGE   AGE
eks-protect-vault   Available                     4s
```
### 6. Create Trident Protect Application
To perform data protection operations on your EKS applications, you need to create a Trident Protect `Application` resource. 
To define the namespaces in which the application resources exist in, use `spec.includedNamespaces` and specify namespace labels or a namespace name.
You can use this sample [trident-application.yaml](./manifests/trident-application.yaml) manifest to define an `Application` for our sample-app.
```yaml
apiVersion: protect.trident.netapp.io/v1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: sample-app
  namespace: tenant0
spec:
  includedNamespaces:
    - namespace:  tenant0
```
Run the following to create the `Application`:
```shell
kubectl create -f ../manifests/trident-application.yaml
```
To check the `Application` was created successfully run the following command:
```shell
kubectl get application -n tenant0
```
Expected output:
```shell
NAME         PROTECTION STATE   AGE
sample-app   None               14s
```
### 7. Create Application Backup
Trident Protect has several data protection options available:
1. [On-Demand Snapshot](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-protect/trident-protect-protect-apps.html#create-an-on-demand-snapshot)
2. [On-Demand Backup](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-protect/trident-protect-protect-apps.html#create-an-on-demand-backup)
3. [Data Protection Schedule](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-protect/trident-protect-protect-apps.html#create-a-data-protection-schedule)
4. [Application replication](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-protect/trident-protect-use-snapmirror-replication.html)
5. [Application migration](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-protect/trident-protect-migrate-apps.html)

> [!NOTE] 
> In this blog, we will focus on On-Demand Backup and Application Migration, but you can read more about how to use the other data protection options in the link references above.

To create an on-demand backup for our sample application, we will create a `Backup` resource for the `Application` we just create and point it to our S3 created `AppVault`. You can use the following [trident-backup.yaml](./manifests/trident-backup.yaml) sample manifest:
```yaml
apiVersion: protect.trident.netapp.io/v1
kind: Backup
metadata:
  namespace: tenant0
  name: sample-app-backup-1
spec:
  applicationRef: sample-app
  appVaultRef: eks-protect-vault
```
Run the following to create the `Backup`:
```shell
kubectl create -f ../manifests/trident-backup.yaml
```
To check if the `Backup` was created successfully run the following command:
```shell
kubectl get backup -n tenant0
```
Expected output:
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The state of the `Backup` can be `running` while the backup is in progress. Wait until the status gets to `Completed`. If the status is `Failed`, use `kubectl describe backup -n tenant0 sample-app-backup-1` to get more details on the failure. 
```shell
NAME                  APP          RECLAIM POLICY   STATE       ERROR   AGE
sample-app-backup-1   sample-app   Retain           Completed           9m33s
``` 
> [!TIP]
> If you check your `Application` Protection State, it is now set to `Partial` since you just have an on-demand backup set for your application, but no backup schedule. You can use `kubectl describe application -n tenant0` to check the status. 

### 8. Restore Application from a Backup
Trident Protect has several recovery options available:
1. Restore from backup
    - [Restore from a backup to a different namespace](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-protect/trident-protect-restore-apps.html#restore-from-a-backup-to-a-different-namespace)
    - [Restore from a backup to the original namespace](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-protect/trident-protect-restore-apps.html#restore-from-a-backup-to-the-original-namespace)
    - [Restore from a backup to a different cluster](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-protect/trident-protect-restore-apps.html#restore-from-a-backup-to-a-different-cluster)
2. Restore from Snapshot
    - [Restore from a snapshot to a different namespace](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-protect/trident-protect-restore-apps.html#restore-from-a-snapshot-to-a-different-namespace)
    - [Restore from a snapshot to the original namespace](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-protect/trident-protect-restore-apps.html#restore-from-a-snapshot-to-the-original-namespace)

> [!NOTE] 
> In this blog, we will focus on restoring our sample-app backup to a different namespace on the same EKS cluster. Still, you can read more about how to use the other recovery options on the link references above.

Let's review the `BackupRestore` resources spec:
- `spec.appArchivePath` - The path inside AppVault where the backup contents are stored
> [!TIP]
> You can retrieve the Archive Path by issuing the following command on your backup:
> ```shell
> kubectl get backup sample-app-backup-1 -n tenant0 -o jsonpath='{.status.appArchivePath}'
>```
- `spec.appVaultRef` - The name of the `AppVault` where the backup contents are stored
- `spec.namespaceMapping` -  mapping of the source namespace of the restore operation to the destination namespace

You can use the following [trident-protect-backup-restore.yaml](./manifests/trident-protect-backup-restore.yaml) sample manifest:
```yaml
---
apiVersion: protect.trident.netapp.io/v1
kind: BackupRestore
metadata:
  name: sample-app-restore-1
  namespace: tenant1
spec:
  appArchivePath: <APP ARCHIVE PATH>
  appVaultRef: eks-protect-vault
  namespaceMapping: 
    - source: tenant0
      destination: tenant1
  resourceFilter:
    resourceSelectionCriteria: "Exclude"
    resourceMatchers:
      - kind: TargetGroupBinding
```
If you need to select only specific resources of the application to restore, add filtering that includes or excludes resources marked with particular labels. 
- `resourceFilter.resourceSelectionCriteria` - Use Include or Exclude to include or exclude a resource defined in `resourceMatchers`.
- `resourceFilter.resourceMatchers`:
    - `resourceMatchers[].group`: Group of the resource to be filtered
    - `resourceMatchers[].kind`: Kind of the resource to be filtered 
    - `resourceMatchers[].version`: Version of the resource to be filtered
    - `resourceMatchers[].names`: Names in the Kubernetes metadata.name field of the resource to be filtered
    - `resourceMatchers[].namespaces`: Namespaces in the Kubernetes metadata.name field of the resource to be filtered
    - `resourceMatchers[].labelSelectors`: Label selector string in the Kubernetes metadata.name field of the resource

Sample code to add to your `BackupRestore` mantifest:  
```yaml
spec:
  resourceFilter:
    resourceSelectionCriteria: "Include"
    resourceMatchers:
      - group: my-resource-group-1
        kind: my-resource-kind-1
        version: my-resource-version-1
        names: ["my-resource-names"]
        namespaces: ["my-resource-namespaces"]
        labelSelectors: ["trident.netapp.io/os=linux"]
```
> [!NOTE]
> For our application recovery, since it's using a LoadBalancer Type service in EKS, we'll exclude the `TargetGroupBinding` resources so that the [AWS Load Balancer Controller](https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/aws-load-balancer-controller/latest/) can create a new `TargetGroupBinding` for our new namespace that will not be in conflict with our existing application on the cluster. 

Run the following to create the `BackupRestore`:
```shell
kubectl create -f ../manifests/trident-protect-backup-restore.yaml
```
To check if the `BackupRestore` was created successfully run the following command:
```shell
kubectl get backuprestore -n tenant1
```
Expected output:
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The state of the `BackupRestore` can be `running` while the restore is in progress. Wait until the status gets to `Completed`. If the status is `Failed`, use `kubectl describe backuprestore -n tenant1 sample-app-restore-1` to get more details on the failure. 
```shell
NAME                   STATE       ERROR   AGE
sample-app-restore-1   Completed           115s
```

After the restore process is finished, you can verify that your recovered application is up and running by accessing the UI service endpoint in your browser. 

> [!NOTE]
> You can get the UI service endpoint by issuing the following command:
> ```shell
> kubectl get svc ui -n tenant1 --output jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname}'
> ```
If everything was successful, you should get the UI that looks like this:
![sample-ui](images/sample-ui.png)

### 9. Migrate Between storage services
On this step, we'll migrate parts of our sample application stateful services from one storage service to another. We'll do that using the `storageClassMapping` feature of the Trident Protect `BackupRestore`. 

We'll migrate the catalog service MySQL database from and an EBS volume to an FSxN block volume. 

To do that, we'll execute two `BackupRestore` resources - one will recover all sample-application resources and data except for the `catalog-mysql` statefulset, and the other will recover and migrate the `catalog-mysql` statefulset from EBS to FSxN block storage.. 
Review the [trident-protect-migrate.yaml](./manifests/trident-protect-migrate.yaml). Notice we're using `resourceFilter` to exclude and include resources from the recovery process and `storageClassMapping` to migrate stateful resources to different storage backends. 

```yaml
  resourceFilter:
    resourceSelectionCriteria: "Exclude"
    resourceMatchers:
      - kind: StatefulSet
        names: ["catalog-mysql"]
      - kind: TargetGroupBinding
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure you update `spec.appArchivePath` on both resources. You can retrieve the Archive Path by issuing the following command on your backup:
> ```shell
> kubectl get backup sample-app-backup-1 -n tenant0 -o jsonpath='{.status.appArchivePath}'
>```
Run the following to create the `BackupRestore` resources required for the migration:
```shell
kubectl create -f ../manifests/trident-protect-migrate.yaml
```
To check if the `BackupRestore` resources were created successfully run the following command:

```shell
kubectl get backuprestore -n tenant2
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The state of the `BackupRestore` can be `running` while the restore is in progress. Wait until the status gets to `Completed`. If the status is `Failed`, use `kubectl describe backuprestore -n tenant2 sample-app-migrate-#` to get more details on the failure. 

Expected result: 
```shell
NAME                   STATE       ERROR   AGE
sample-app-migrate-1   Completed           26m
sample-app-migrate-2   Completed           38s
```

We can now check that our catalog-mysql PVC was migrated from EBS to FSxN by issuing the following command: 
```shell
kubectl get pvc data-catalog-mysql-0 -n tenant2
```
Expected result: 
```shell
NAME                   STATUS   VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS      VOLUMEATTRIBUTESCLASS   AGE
data-catalog-mysql-0   Bound    pvc-8e45fa11-13ad-490d-b70c-d649b6fef4e9   30Gi       RWO            trident-csi-san   <unset>                 118s
```

You can check the source application and see that the original volume is using EBS by using the same command:
```shell
kubectl get pvc data-catalog-mysql-0 -n tenant0
```
Expected result:
```shell
NAME                   STATUS   VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS   VOLUMEATTRIBUTESCLASS   AGE
data-catalog-mysql-0   Bound    pvc-0d795501-aca2-4e10-98b5-111ecc3aef2c   30Gi       RWO            ebs-csi        <unset>                 71m
```

After the migration process is finished, you can verify if your migrated application is up and running by accessing the UI service endpoint in your browser. 

> [!NOTE]
> You can get the UI service endpoint but issuing the following command:
> ```shell
> kubectl get svc ui -n tenant2 --output jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname}'
> ```
If everything was successful you should get the UI that looks like this:
![sample-ui](images/sample-ui.png)

Congratulations! You've completed and mastered the basics of EKS backup, recovery, and migration using NetApp Trident Protect. This guide can be used as a best practice to implement protection, migration, and disaster recovery in your environment. 

### Clean-up 
To avoid unnecessary charges, make sure you delete all resources by running the following script from your terminal: 
```shell
sh ../scripts/cleanup.sh
```
